# ChebAE

An implementation and benchmark of the ChebAE algorithm from [arXiv:2207.08628](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08628). This is the code that was used to generate the data presented in the research paper. The entire implementation is in the [chebae.ipynb](chebae.ipynb) jupyter notebook.

In April 2023 we added a modified version of the algorithm called ChebPE which estimates the probability $p = a^2$ instead of the amplitude $a$. This algorithm is presented and benchmarked in [chebpe.ipynb](chebpe.ipynb).
